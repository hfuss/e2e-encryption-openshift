## End-to-end Encryption for Spring Boot Apps on OpenShift
**Hayden Fuss**
**Rough Draft**

### End-to-End Encryption in Kubernetes/OpenShift

Explain the difficulties, certain ways of solving it.

Describe the assumptions about the OpenShift configuration, and
explain the autogenerated certificates feature.

### Overview of HTTPS with Spring Boot

Show `application.yml` snippets that are required. Point out the caveat of needing
a keystore. Explain some of the drawbacks of keystores i.e. reloading certs.

### Creating PKCS12 Keystores with OpenSSL

Walking through the simple Bash with `openssl` that can take a set of PEMs
and make a generic keystore.

### Bootstrapping Spring Boot with HTTPS via Init Containers

Combine the `application.yml` with the `keystore.sh`, and tie it all together
with Kubernetes and the special Service.

### Conclusions
